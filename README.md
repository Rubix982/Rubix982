# Security Projects List

I am currently working on and maintaining the below repositories,

1. [SecChapter - Rubix982](https://github.com/Rubix982/SecChapter) - In the middle of 2024, I decided that my long term goal and my life-long legacy would be my mastery in the Cloud, Cybersecurity, and DevOps area. This is a goal I believe will take the next decade of my life, and more. To maintain all of my progress and to look back on all I have or will accomplish, I maintain `SecChapter` that touches on many things that are related to Cybsecurity, Information Networking, and the Cloud
2. [StructDiff - Rubix982](https://github.com/Rubix982/StructDiff) - Often, I have found existing JSON online tools to be tricky and split into many places -- StructDiff is what I started keeping in mind making it easy to see the structural differences between any two JSONs, but is not primarily limited by the idea
3. [ScrapChat - Rubix982](https://github.com/Rubix982/ScrapChat) - With a growing number of AI tools, the problem comes to organising all the content generated for anyone's quick viewing in one place. `ScrapChat` promises to parse the response by ChatGPT to output in an organised fashion
4. [ps - Rubix982](https://github.com/Rubix982/ps) - I realised I need to create valuable useful tooling in security to be a proper Cybersecurity specialist -- in that note, I wanted to start `ps`, a packet sniffer and network attack monitor one can deploy on their infrastructure that would be written in `Rust`
5. [argo-apps - Rubix982](https://github.com/Rubix982/argo-apps) - A repository that will contain demos of using ArgoCD as an orchestrator to explore technical challenges for setting up a distributed system. Tags can include "workflows".
6. [NetPulse - Rubix982](https://github.com/Rubix982/NetPulse) - A project to start, but internet speeds have been bothering me for many weeks now -- I wanted something that periodically got network results and stored them for personal view
7. [VulnData - Rubix982](https://github.com/Rubix982/VulnData) - A project I will start focusing on more in the coming year (2025), but it is intended to be a large dataset of scraped data regarding vulnerabilities for future LLM training and assistance in analyzing vulnerabilities in code
8. [CyberScope - A Comprehensive Analysis Repository](https://github.com/Rubix982/CyberScope-A-Comprehensive-Analysis-Repository/) - a repository to contain analysis of many datasets mentioned under a Kaggle dataset page

## Ideas/Misc Section

1. [Cyberflow](https://github.com/Rubix982/Cyberflow) - A Go-based Temporal orchestrator that scans project dependencies and threat intel (like hashes, packages, IPs) using VirusTotal, OSV, and other APIs, caching results in PebbleDB for fast lookup and storing enriched data in DuckDB for structured analysis.
2. [Triage](https://github.com/Rubix982/triage) - Cross-platform Electron app for structured issue triage with React, Tailwind, D3.js, and DuckDB-WASM.
3. [Thoughts](https://github.com/Rubix982/thoughts) - A thoughts CLI utility for note-taking for devs.
4. [EsMappingTests](https://github.com/Rubix982/es-mapping-tests) - Some ES mapping related tests.

Hi, I’m Saif!

I’m from Pakistan, in my final year at FAST NUCES, Karachi, majoring in Computer Science. Technically, I'm practicing Open Source Software Development, DevOps, Cloud, Computer Networking, Software Engineering, Full Stack Web Dev Engineering, Production Production & SRE, Database Administration, Technical Writing, Linux, and have touched briefly on Data Science, Frontend Design here and there.

Why so many domains? I wanted to understand each of all to a degree informing my decisions over what it takes to build a product from scratch.

My primary aim right is to target Cloud, DevOps, Backend Engineering, develop skills over Cloud/DevOps/Networking/System Administration. For the future, I'm aiming for Site Reliability Engineering/Production Engineering, Software Engineering, Full Stack Web Development, and wherever life is willing to take me.

Other than technical stuff, I :heart: to work with teams, contributing to open source, recognizing business problems, evaluating requirements, being part of hackathons and group efforts for a project, learning from teammates and experiences. A project is probably nothing withou a community that uses and builds it.

<h1 align="left">What Am I Doing These Days</h1>

Difficult answer. I'll split it into two parts,

<h2 align="left">I'm Definitely Working On ...</h2>

- Being an [Open Source Fellow @MLH](https://fellowship.mlh.io/)! Amazing experience for community folks
- [Mapillary](https://github.com/facebookexternal/mapillary-python-sdk) - a project under Facebook Reality Labs, to release a Python 3 library built on the Mapillary API v4 to facilitate retrieving and working with Mapillary data. This is for the GeoInformatics community as an Open Source resource for everyone out there who wishes to get easy access to [Mapillary's Gigantic Dataset](https://www.mapillary.com/app/). Expect a major release soon!
- [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina), building a [Protein Search Prototype](https://github.com/georgeamccarthy/protein_search/pull/30) using Jina as a Neural Search Engine. I'm working currently on the Ops part by containerizing the application
- [Meshery](https://layer5.io/) as a contributor. "The service mesh management plane" for deploying, configuring, operating, measuring, tuning a Microservice architecture. I'm just starting, but it's extremely exciting to be a part of it
- [Y Combinator, Startup School '21](https://www.ycombinator.com/library), "Startup School" is a free online program for founders actively pursuing their own startup. It employs a 6 week program for batches where a team can work together weekly, have discussions and coordinating learning efforts and skill sharing relating heavily to startups!
- [SIG Interoperability - Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability), as a community member over what efforts the Open Source community can make for tackling the interoperability problem across the CI/CD ecosystem of tools and technologies
- Reading either ["Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems"](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) or ["Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems"](https://www.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Production-Systems/dp/149192912X/ref=pd_lpo_3?pd_rd_i=149192912X&psc=1) whenever I'm away from my laptop
- My Final Year Project at FAST NUCES, it's private! Hopefully it's a hit
- Being an open source contributor as much as I can, a promise to myself for sure
- A research paper, slow progress, but I'm trying to get it out this Summer

<h2 align="left">I'm Trying To Get To ...</h2>

A list of things I want to do,

- Exploring and learning Amazon Web Services (AWS), and [AWS-Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
- Build as many projects as I can with whatever time I have

## Roles Interested In

I'm interested in roles about,

- Cloud/Cloud Native ☁️
- Developer Operations (DevOps) 🤖
- Full Stack Web Dev Engineering 🕸️
- Big Data Analysis & Business Intelligence 🧠
- Data Engineering 🚒
- Production Engineering 🦯
- Data Science 👨‍🔬


<h1 align="left">Talk To Me About</h1>

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about #bigdata, #opensource, #dataengineering, #softwaredevelopment, #webdev, or about anything you like really - it doesn't have to be technical - feel free to ask me about my past experiences or ask me about feedback or advice, I'm always up for a conversation.

Thank you. See you soon!
